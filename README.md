# Daily-Internet-Usage-by-Age-Groups-Data-Analysis
## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze daily internet usage behavior across different age groups by examining time spent on social media, work/study, and entertainment, along with device and internet type preferences, in order to derive actionable insights for telecom and digital service providers.

## Questions(KPIs):
- How does total daily screen time differ across age groups?
- Which age groups spend more time on Social media,Work/study,Entertainment?
- What is the preferred device (Mobile, Laptop, Tablet) by age group?
- How does internet type (WiFi vs Mobile Data) vary with age?
- Are younger users more dependent on mobile data compared to older users?
- Which age group contributes the highest overall internet consumption?

## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Make sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Project Insights
- Work/study hours remain relatively consistent across all age groups, averaging around 4 hours per day.
- Social media usage is slightly higher among younger age groups (13–25) compared to older users.
- Entertainment usage shows a gradual decline in users aged (60+), indicating lower recreational screen time.
-	Working-age groups (26–45) demonstrate balanced usage across work and entertainment activities.
-	The (36–45) age group records the highest average total screen time, driven by combined work and entertainment usage.
-	Moderate users form the largest segment across all age groups, indicating balanced daily internet usage patterns.
-	Heavy internet users are more concentrated in the (26–45) age range, suggesting higher screen dependency among working-age users.
-	Light usage is comparatively higher among younger (13–18) and older (60+) users, reflecting lower sustained screen engagement.
-	Mobile data usage is relatively higher among the (13–19) and (46–60) age groups, indicating greater reliance on cellular connectivity within these segments.
-	Tablet usage is relatively higher among the (13–19) and (46+) age groups, suggesting niche but distinct usage patterns across younger and older users.
-	Laptop usage peaks among the (26–45) age group, aligning with professional and work-related usage patterns.
-	Mobile devices are most preferred among the (19–35) age group, indicating higher responsiveness to mobile-centric products and campaigns within this segment.
-	Majority of age groups prefer WiFi over Mobile data which indicates home based usage, useful for broadband service planning.
-	These patters suggest targeted device-based marketing could be effective by age group.


## Final Conclusion:
This analysis explored daily internet usage patterns across different age groups by examining activity distribution, usage intensity, device preference, and internet connectivity types. The findings indicate consistent work/study usage across ages, with variations in social, entertainment, and overall screen time driven primarily by age and lifestyle differences. Working-age users (26–45) exhibit higher overall and intensive usage, while younger and older groups show more light and selective usage patterns. Device and connectivity preferences further highlight age-specific behaviors, with mobile, laptop, and WiFi usage varying across demographic segments. Overall, the analysis demonstrates how structured exploratory analysis and visualization can be used to derive meaningful insights into user behavior from raw usage data.
